Cover letter for 'A note on anisotropic quantum gravity':

Dear Editor,

This work is an extension of a work previously published in Chaos, Solitons and Fractals -- doi:10.1016/j.chaos.2008.10.036

In the previous work, we discussed an alternative to dark matter. 
In this new work we quantize gravitation, and discuss the difference between isotropic and anisotropic gravitation.

Of primary interest to the Editor's Office is that the dimension of the gravitational field can be fractional.
Of secondary interest is that the theory put forward is falsifiable.
